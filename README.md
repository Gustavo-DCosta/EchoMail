## What is EchoMail?

EchoMail is a **CLI-native, end-to-end encrypted chat app** for devs, hackers, sysadmins, and rebels with a cause.  
Built with minimalism and **Golang zen** in mind, EchoPulse keeps things lightweight, fast, and deadly silent — no telemetry, no creepy tracking, no fluff.

The server? Just a humble **message router**.  
It *can’t* read your messages — by design. The content is yours. Always.

---

## Why?

Because some of us dream of building startups instead of sleeping in shelters fighting **homeless Jhon** over the last bed.  
Because privacy is not a feature — it’s a **right**.  
Because “secure” shouldn’t mean bloated, ugly, or locked behind subscriptions.  
Because we’re tired of being watched. Yeah, **1984** was a warning, not a how-to manual.

## Who’s it for?

- 🔐 **Privacy freaks** and **paranoid geniuses**  
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers** with billion-dollar ideas and no VC backup  
- 🛠️ **Sysadmins** and **DevOps warriors** tired of Slack and spying SaaS  
- 🖥️ Anyone who vibes with a terminal and wants their convos to stay *theirs*

If you can read a `man` page, EchoPulse speaks your language.

## Who's behind this?

</p>

**Lunaryx Studio** — aka me, a one-man dev army on a mission to build cool sh*t and maybe not go broke doing it.  
Lunaryx isn't a company. It's a **mindset**. A studio for ideas born from insomnia, ambition, and pure chaos.

## Status

EchoPulse is in active development — early build, but already functional.  
We’re cooking plugins, themes, and even a local-only mode for total air-gap comms. 🔒
